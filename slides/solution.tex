	\begin{itemize}
		\item Long short-term memory (LSTM). Hochreiter, Schmidhuber (1997)\cite{lstm}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item the network structure is modified with specialized "memory cells"
				\item a truncated version of back-propagation is employed (but works also without it)
			\end{itemize}
		\pause
		\item Hessian-Free optimization (HF). Martens (2010) \cite{hessianFree}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item a second order method
			\item a "cheap" approximation of the Hessian is employed
			\item the quadratic sub-problem is solved through conjugate gradient + structural damping
		\end{itemize}
		\pause
		\item Pascanu, Bengio (2013) \cite{pascanu}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item a first order method
			\item uses a penalty to deal with the vanishing gradient problem
		\end{itemize}
