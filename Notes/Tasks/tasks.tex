\section{Introduction}
The problems discussed below were first proposed by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber\cite{Hochreiter95longshort-term} as examples of difficult problems because they require learning long term correlations and have
been commonly used as benchmark tasks since.

\section{Temporal order problem}
\section{Addition problem}
The problem consists in performing an addition between two real numbers $x_i$ and $x_j$ in $[-1.1]$ belonging to a sequence of randomly generated numbers. The difficulty in this problem is that such numbers can be arbitraly
distant in the input sequence, so the learning net must exhibit a long term memory. More specifically the input is a sequence of pairs; each pair is composed of a real number and a marker which can be in
$\{1,0\}$. The marker is used to select the two numbers in the sequence to add. The prediction is the last value in the output sequence, the target is $\frac{x_i+x_j}{2}$. The prediction $y$ is considered correct
if $|y-\frac{x_i+x_j}{2}| < 0.04$.

Sequences have random length, say $L$, between the minimal sequence length $T$ and $T+\frac{T}{10}$, the position of the first marker is sampled in first $\frac{L}{10}$ positions, the last marker is
instead sampled in $[\frac{4L}{10},\frac{5L}{10}]$

\section{Multiplication problem}
The problem is very similar to the addition problem, here we select two numbers in the input sequences of real numbers in $[0,1]$ and we need to predict the product.

\section{Random permutation problem}
