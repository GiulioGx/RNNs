\section{Introduction}
The problems discussed below were first proposed by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber\cite{Hochreiter95longshort-term} as examples of difficult problems becouse they require learning long term correlations and have
been commonly used as benchmark tasks since.

\section{Temporal order problem}
\section{Addition problem}
The problem consists in performing an addition between two real numbers $x_i$ and $x_j$ in $[-1.1]$ belonging to a sequence of randomly generated numbers. The difficulty in this problem is that such numbers can be arbitraly
distant in the input sequence, so the learnining net must exibit a long term memory. More specifically the input is a sequence of pairs; each pair is composed of a real number and a marker which can be in
$\{1,0\}$. The marker is used to select the two numbers in the sequence to add. The prediciton is the last value in the output sequence, the target is $\frac{x_i+x_j}{2}$. The predicion $y$ is considered correct
if $|y-\frac{x_i+x_j}{2}| < 0.04$
